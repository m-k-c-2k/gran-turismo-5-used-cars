# gran-turismo-5-used-cars
Finds cars in the Used Car Dealership of Gran Turismo 5.

# How to use the program
Enter the model code of the car that is on the top left of your used car list when sorted by dealer acquisition. You can find it in the file "models.txt".

Then, find the generated 30-car list that matches your own (again, sorted by dealer acquisition, and sorted left-to-right, top-to-bottom).

Enter the model code of the car you're searching for.

The program will find how many days later that car will appear in the dealership.
